  <h2 class='c006'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Edaville Railroad</i> isn’t a complete story of Ellis D. Atwood’s midget
cranberry line. It isn’t an all-time history of the odd and colorful
little roads that preceded it and of which the <i>Cranberry Belt</i> is
the last and final survivor.</p>

<p class='c001'>A while ago Mr. Atwood suggested writing-up his Lilliputian carrier
for the benefit of his host of visitors who aren’t as familiar as
we are with such abbreviated railroad sizes. Something concise yet
generally explanatory, answering most of the questions that might
pop into your mind. Something to give you a fairly good idea of
what the Edaville Railroad is and what its forebears have been.
Something complete enough to cover the subject in a cursory way and
still be printed to sell for the price of a ticket at Edaville, if he was
selling tickets here.</p>

<p class='c001'>No book has ever been written telling completely, in words or pictures,
the all-time story of these diminutive lines. Maybe sometime
one will be, and your reception to this booklet could be a deciding
factor.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, <i>Edaville Railroad</i> will be a helpful guide-book for your
visit here and your ride on the Tom Thumb train. Or, if you aren’t
already down here, it will show you what you’re missing!</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I don’t like this&#8212;prefatory pages in books. Why can’t we speak
our piece in the main text without expecting a feller to wade through
Forewords, Prefaces, and Prologues? We can, if our gray-matter is
agile enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>But&#8212;my <i>Introduction</i>!</p>

<p class='c001'>The world’s railroads aren’t all the same, you know. Width of
track, or <i>gauge</i>, varies. Standard gauge, as 'most everyone knows, is
four-feet, eight-and-one-half inches between the rails and there are
plenty of hypotheses about how it got that way.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few roads are wider than standard&#8212;five-feet, and five-and-a-half.
Years ago you could even go all the way from New York to
Chicago on tracks six feet wide. England once made merry on some
<i>seven</i> foot gauge.</p>

<p class='c001'>Narrower gauge was much more common. Three feet and three-and-a-half
once claimed thousands of miles. Why! In Grandpa’s
day there were no less than thirty-seven different gauges of track in
our fair land, and Lord only knows how many the foreign countries
had, with their millimeters and other measuring sticks. Today, in
North America, the four-feet, eight-and-a-half-inchers have pretty
well switched the non-standard lines off the railroad map.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of our own 227,000 miles of line 99-1/2 per cent is standard gauge,
a scant 932 being something else&#8212;724 of it the Colorado three-footers.
On only 380 miles is there a semblance of passenger service!
Of Canada’s 42,000 miles, 90 is narrow gauge&#8212;the three-foot
White Pass &#38; Yukon Route. Mexico, however, hangs onto her
slim gauge a little better and 2,400 of her total 12,600 miles of road
is three-feet wide. The 809 mile Newfoundland Railway, three-and-a-half
feet narrow, is likewise prosperously content with its non-conformity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the whole world’s railway mileage, 788,000&#8212;but let’s not get
too involved here. Anyway, foreign lands still consider economical
transportation more important than the distance between the rails,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>and many miles of narrow tracks still thread hill and dale beyond
the seas.</p>

<p class='c001'>The very narrowest of them all, excepting some industrial tramway
or miniature freak, was the vaunted two-footer. Sixty-centimeter,
they call ’em over there, which is just another way of saying
twenty-three and five-eighths inches. England had a few, and France
has her famous “decaville” railways. The far East, Africa, and
Australia still run generous two-foot mileage, and Latin America is
pretty fond of the little cusses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Up here in our country, half a century ago, they blossomed like
roses at sunrise, bloomed lustily through the morning, but wilted ere
there’d been time for the winds of Fate to blow their pollen around
in good shape.</p>

<p class='c001'>The top-puff midgets were the stout little virtuosi up in Maine.
Their bantam chests jingled merrily with medals they’d won. A few
scattered hybrids did some anemic bush-pushing elsewhere&#8212;one in
Pennsylvania, one in New Mexico, and a third in Colorado’s icy
mountains. They weren’t <i>real</i> railroads, though. Either industrial
outfits or kind of street-carrish affairs. That’s why I skipped ’em
here. Had to draw the line somewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ten two-footers in Maine boasted about 212 miles of line.
They were built and run like the big railroads. Had freight, and
passenger trains. Were governed by the same laws and regulations.
And were immensely vital to the loves and lives of the neighborhood.
Their smoky smells were just as alluring and they could holler just
as loud. I always thought they were a bit more democratic and hail-fellow-well-met
than the more decorous grownups. Colorful, and
kind of dramatic, too!</p>

<p class='c001'>They passed, not because folks wanted all railroads alike. Not
because they didn’t measure up. Worse than that. They limped
into the sunset because people didn’t use them any more. Their
<i>gauge</i> made no difference. Plenty of standard gauges puffed into
the limbo too. Neither could run without money. The two-footers
stood it longer than their more expensive relatives of wider size.
No. Their narrow gauge wasn’t the reason although the standardization
tycoons beefed about non-conformity and the cost of transferring
freight.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The decade of the 1930’s saw them go. For a while longer the
Bridgton line and the little Monson were tolerated by some and
cherished by a few, but when clouds of Peace darkened the war-red
sky they were gone&#8212;the last two-footer had whistled off leaving only
memory-trains to scoot through the mid-regions of the past.</p>

<p class='c001'>That’s why the Edaville Railroad stands out. Why it’s a splendid
anti-climax to an era of colorful midget railroading. Not so much
because it’s the last survivor, as I persist in calling it, as a resurrection&#8212;an
ideal risen from the ashes of Yesterday.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here it is: not a synthetical reproduction but those very same
engines and cars that made railroad history for three generations,
alive and puffing again on Ellis Atwood’s eighteen-hundred acres.
A seed from history that now blooms with the cranberries, sprouting
in that same sand that perennializes faded shrubs from the Holy
Commonwealth, Plymouth Colony, America in the making.</p>

<p class='c001'>That’s why I had to have an <i>Introduction</i>. All right?</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>EDAVILLE RAILROAD<br><br><span class='sc'>The Cranberry Belt</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Well, well, well; just look at this&#8212;</p>

<p class='c001'>The Edaville Railroad. Eighteen hundred acres long and only
two feet wide!</p>

<p class='c001'>Let’s look it over. There’s nothing like it anywhere. As if Plymouth
County and the town of Carver weren’t famous enough already,
not to mention Ellis Atwood’s model cranberry plantation,
this little narrow gauge railroad now vies with cranberry crops and
<i>Mayflower</i> packets in spectacular “firsts”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Plymouth, you know, is famous far and wide for being the stern
and rockbound coast where the Pilgrims debarked three hundred and
twenty-seven years ago. That’s Fourth Grade stuff. Also pretty well
known, this historical region is first in world cranberry growing. Yes.
Grows more little red berries on its pleasant, frugiferous acres than
the rest of the world combined. To top this off Carver boasts first
place among the cranberry towns, its 2,800 acres of bog harvesting
100,000 barrels a year&#8212;fifteen per cent of the whole world’s crop!
No argument about our list of “firsts” so far, is there?</p>

<p class='c001'>While we’re firsting: ages ago, when Carver was the first iron producing
corner of the New World, the very first iron teakettle made in
America is said to have been cast here&#8212;from Carver iron, Carver
smelter, and moulded in Carver sand.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, back to that corner of the town that’s Ellis Atwood’s own, private
first&#8212;eighteen hundred acre Edaville.</p>

<p class='c001'>Edaville, 210 acres of actual bog, is the biggest privately owned
cranberry business in the world. Nearly 10,000 barrels of the sour
little things grow here every year.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this, with ultra-attractive buildings and equipment, is enough
to set Mr. Atwood and his Thanksgiving sauce up as high as a block-signal.
But wait: his Edaville Railroad!</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  One of the first Edaville freight trains, with railroad fan John Holt at the throttle of Monson engine No. 4.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The Edaville Railroad is maybe the most spectacular of all these
interesting “firsts”. It’s even more so because it’s the last&#8212;but we’ll
come to this <i>last</i> part later. Let’s consider the <i>first</i>, first.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first of all these famous Massachusetts cranberry lands to have
a real, he-man, tobacco-chewing railroad, complete to the last fishplate,
resplendent to the last parlor-car, and unbelievably efficient
with its excellent big-railed track, stout little engines, and wonderland
cars. Its importance as a plantation utility and, finally, the holiday
fun it gives you thousands of visitors who’re making it a Sunday spa
and a railroad fans’ Mecca.</p>

<p class='c001'>That’s the Edaville Railroad, the Cranberry Belt: first of its kind,
you see.</p>

<p class='c001'>It’s the last one, too.</p>

<p class='c001'>A cloud of nostalgia dims the brilliance of Edaville lights when we
think of this side of the story. <i>Last of the two-foot gauges.</i> Final
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>survivor of the colorful midgets that once puffed around our heterogeneous
land.</p>

<p class='c001'>Want to look it over? I thought so; Mr. Atwood is busy right now,
and why wouldn’t he be with the biggest one-man cranberry plantation
on earth, plus a little million civic and philanthropic affairs to
see to? I’ll show you around. Come on!</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we are&#8212;the screenhouse. Cranberry bogs have screenhouses
the same as railroads have trains. These screenhouses, where berries
are cleaned and graded and prepared for market, may be anything
from a rough shed to this super structure here. This is the first one
of its kind, too: a big, yet compact, brick show-place housing not only
the berry equipment and the car shops, the company offices including
Mr. Atwood’s own private sanctum (most admired spot in Edaville!),
but brimming with storage space as well.</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  Mr. Atwood’s model screenhouse, the finest in the world, built in 1940 at a cost of&#8212;well, that doesn’t matter.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The railroad really begins here. Maybe that’s because the first
rails were laid into it for car repairing. There, clustering around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>like chicks with Mama Hen, is the railroad station and most of the
yards.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'><p>  No dieselization on the Edaville. Here passenger extra No. 7 sails past work train on sandpit spur.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What a sight! Cranberry architecture and railroad artistry all
mixed together under the green pine trees. See the vivid contrast&#8212;yellow
sand and the bright blue sky. The red freight cars, and green
passenger coaches sporting their goldleaf name of <i>Edaville</i> along the
sides.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eh? Those other names? Oh; Mr. Atwood restored these cars
to their original appearance and part of his pristine program was to
letter several of them as they were in the beginning. The parlor-car
is <i>Sandy River &#38; Rangeley Lakes</i>, one ancient coach is <i>Bridgton &#38;
Saco River</i>, and that other one once rolled over the old <i>Wiscasset &#38;
Quebec</i> rails. The idea makes a hit, too.</p>

<p class='c001'>See&#8212;there are some trains scurrying about their cranberry work,
while that string of shiny passenger cars at the station, headed by the
impatient little homuncular engine, is waiting to take you for a ride.</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  No. 7 hauls Mr. Atwood’s passenger train, loaded with a hundred of his guests.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>We’ll walk over. (No; that dog won’t bite.) Some station, isn’t
it? Just built this Spring. Thousands of people visit Edaville every
week; I guess lots of them hurry right by Plymouth Rock to come
over here. That’s why Mr. Atwood decided he needed a passenger
station.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, it’s quite a place; besides the usual station fixtures it has a
real Fred Harveyish kind of restaurant, a museum, waiting-room,
and social hall besides. That’s where they get together for club
meetings, speeches when some speechster is here, yarn-swapping, and
to look at all the interesting railroad relics and pictures on display
there. There’ll be some barracks upstairs someday, where visitors
may bed down for a night or two.</p>

<p class='c001'>End of the line? No, not exactly. The tracks go right by the station.
That’s because it’s on a little loop encircling Mr. Atwood’s
model Edaville village&#8212;screenhouse, railroad, and all those cozy
cottages where his employees live&#8212;and joins the main line again half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a mile away. We’ll see the switch when we go out. Trains can go
out of this station three different ways. You’ll see.</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  Mr. and Mrs. Atwood smile beside of their de luxe coach “Elthea”, named in her honor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. 7’s hauling the excursion train today. Want to see her? A
trim little pot, don’t you think? Baldwin built her thirty-four years
ago and she was the biggest two-foot gauge engine ever built then.
Thirty-five tons wrapped up there. Doesn’t look it, does she? Her
outside frames enclose four thirty-five inch drivers that can really
roll. Hundred and eighty pounds of steam, twelve-by-sixteen inch
cylinders. You won’t see it today but she can bat ’em off at a sixty
mile clip!</p>

<p class='c001'>Like most of this equipment No. 7 came from the Bridgton &#38; Saco
River, up in Maine.</p>

<p class='c001'>This tricky little car hooked to her tail was the B. &#38; S. R.’s Railway
Post Office, Express, and Baggage car. Yes, they used to have a
regular mail contract, postal clerks and all. That was before the
other war.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>This coach, too, was a Bridgton car, the old <i>Pondicherry</i>. Laconia
Car Works built her and a mate, the <i>Mount Pleasant</i>, when the road
was new, sixty-four years ago. Of course, Mr. Atwood has refinished
and renovated them all. When we go out on the train please notice
those coaches down in the yard: the one with double windows and
stained glass was a fine idea of two-foot de luxe coach accommodations.
She’s the <i>Elthea</i>, named for Elthea Atwood, Mr. Atwood’s
wife. A proper tribute, too, because she works right with him in
everything&#8212;cranberry business, railroad, and all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now: this smooth little wagon on the rear here, <i>that’s</i> the parlor
car.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ever hear of the old Sandy River parlor car? You must have!
It’s been in print ever since Jackson &#38; Sharpe built it, 'way back
when. In 1901, to be exact.</p>

end: two leather seats and a couple of chairs. And in here is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>lavatory in one corner and the car heater in the other&#8212;hot water.
This spacious cubical to your left is the toilet; no shoe-horn needed
there, eh? Plenty of room for the old bustles and hoop skirts to
swish around.</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  Interior of parlor car “Rangeley”.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now we’re in the parlor car proper: just see those swivel chairs
with their lush, green upholstery; the deep, filigreed carpet covering
the floor. Fit for the millionaires who used to ride in her, eh?</p>

<p class='c001'>Each seat has a number, up over the window. Time was, years
ago, when you coughed up an extra simoleon to ride in this buggy.
A colored porter, who’d left New York the night before, stepped
from his big Pullman into this baby-carriage to brush off your dandruff
on the forty-seven mile run through Franklin County’s hills to
Rangeley&#8212;a swanky resort in those days.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Rangeley</i> was the car’s name, too: <i>Rangeley No. 9</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Sandy River was abandoned in 1935 the little <i>Rangeley</i>,
none the worse for her generation of scooting through sunny valleys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and boreal storms, was bought by a doctor in Strong, Maine for two
hundred dollars. His big house was right beside the old main line
and they left the parlor car in his own dooryard, sitting on four sticks
of sixty-pound rail she’d rolled over so many times.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='rj'>(<i>Moody Photo</i>)</div>
<div class='ic002'><p>  With all the decorum of her wide gauge sisters the little “Rangeley” trails the passenger train along the twisting dikes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He died. Then a connoisseur of antiquity who just couldn’t see
her sold for a hen-house or a camp, bought her. Later on Mr. Atwood
got her from him. Came down here on a big trailer one twenty-below-zero
morning. Imagine a parlor car breezing along the highway!</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, looks like we’re ready to go. Let’s stay here on the rear
platform. Good place to view the sights.</p>

<p class='c001'>Starts smoothly? Sure: could be the <i>Federal</i> leaving Grand Central.
These little trains ride all right. When track’s kept up you
can’t tell ’em from standard gauge.</p>

<p class='c001'>The enginehouse will be over there. Six stalls: four for the engines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and two for some of the motor cars. Motor cars? Oh yes,
there are motor cars. You’ll see some before we get back.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look up there at the screenhouse: those big doors are the car shop
tracks. Holds six or eight cars in there. These are the main yards
we’re going through now; storage, mostly. See that track on the
higher level over there? Goes to the screenhouse door where berries
are unloaded in harvesting time. Screen and grade ’em in there.
Stiff climb up that bank, too. Makes the little engines grunt.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is quite a yard. Confusing, too, until you get it fixed in your
mind. It’s like this: the track we’re on now is the original main line
out of Edaville&#8212;down through these yards and out onto the bogs.
Now, since the railroad was completed, it’s kind of an alternative
cutoff, I’d say.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>When Mr. Atwood surveyed the station loop (oh, he does all his
own surveying!) he branched it off this line about half a mile down
from here. That’s the switch I told you we’d see when we went out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>A train coming in off the bogs can go around the loop into the station,
then keep on going just as we’re going now, over this track, and
back onto the bogs again.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Running to the upper end of the Atwood property the line swings
east; to our right, it’ll be. Circles down the shore of big Number
Two reservoir and, instead of re-entering the main stem again it
comes into these yards from a totally different direction&#8212;on that
track to your left, across the canal. A train coming in that way
would head into the station just the opposite to our direction. But
she could proceed around the little loop and come into the switch
below us here and head onto the bogs the same way we’re going.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another way: if we’d left the station just now and thrown a switch
at the other end of this yard, we’d have branched across the canal
onto that track over there, and proceeded around the line just the
other way from our present direction. Confusing, yes; but you’ll
get it straightened out when we’ve been around. Western slants or
eastern perspectives, it’s still the last two-foot gauge we’re riding on!</p>

<p class='c001'>We’re in the grove now. Pretty, isn’t it? Before the big wind of
three or four years ago this was a forest of beautiful pines. That
gale played havoc here as well as down on the coast; blew down over
half of Mr. Atwood’s pet pine trees. He felt pretty sorry at the time
but now agrees that maybe railroad yards are more pleasing than
the whispering conifers were!</p>

<p class='c001'>How do you like the sound of No. 7’s whistle? Euphonious as any
wide-gauge tooter, eh? He’s blowing for Barboza’s Crossing. We’re
leaving the yards. See that cottage there&#8212;Mr. Barboza used to have
a big, ugly rooster; that hellion would attack trains and humans
alike. My shins used to be all gory where he’d clumb me and I
strongly suspect that under his bristling feathers there were black-and-blue
spots, too! No; the train didn’t mash him. We hoped it
would, but he was too smart. Barboza had to chop his head off three
times before the tartar went down for the count.</p>

<p class='c001'>There: here’s your first cranberry bog, Number Six. Pretty, too;
especially when it’s in bloom. Looks like some strange kind of
landscape gardening. This embankment under us is all “turf work”.
Ever hear of “turfing”? Neither had I, until I came down here. It’s
all right, too: instead of expensive retaining walls or rip-rap they just
cut a lot of square sods and lay them in a just-so way; and there’s a
strong, dependable vertical wall. Looks neat, I think.</p>

<p class='c001'>Right ahead now is the switch where the loop swings off to the station.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Right here&#8212;see! Pretty piece of track, isn’t it? Winding up
through those woods with sunlight and shadows playing across the
rails. Over here&#8212;see all those timbers? They’re old ties the New
Haven took out of their Cape lines. All creosoted and mostly hard
wood. The New Haven and the Boston &#38; Maine have been pretty
good about helping the Edaville, and Mr. Atwood bought those ties
for less money than the Maine cedar’s cost. He saws ’em in two and
gets a couple of four foot, three inch ties from each one. Makes
wonderful track for these mites to run on.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>We’re skirting the little Number One reservoir now. Cranberry
bogs must have plenty of water. Mr. Atwood has a system of ditches
and canals, controlled by floodgate-thingamajigs, that supply quick
water to any or all his bogs. This flooding may be for pest control
or, in the late fall, to cover berries as a frost protection. Remember
how we often hear radio reports in late September or October, telling
what temperatures can be expected on the cranberry bogs tonight?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Run some water in ’em and old Jack Frost is frustrated! More gates
drain it off quickly when the danger’s past.</p>

<p class='c001'>This country is flat. All the water must be pumped into these
reservoirs from some pond or river. His pumping-station is up beyond
the Ball Park; two or three big electric pumps. I forget how
many million gallons these reservoirs hold. Enough to get you all
wet, anyway.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pretty along here; brown sand and blue water and green woods.
We think the narrow gauge railroad adds a lot to the charm, too.
We’re blowing for Plantation Center now. Will stop there probably.
Want to get off a minute?</p>

<p class='c001'>The Atwoods are strong for landscaping; keep all their grounds so
neat and attractive.</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  Big Lorain-40 shovel ready to load sand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There: this is the western side of the big, eighteen hundred acre
loop; track runs a couple of miles along the west bounds of Mr. Atwood’s
property and past several of the sand-piles and bogs. Bogs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>must be sprinkled with an inch of sand every winter to keep their bed
in proper trim and to combat weeds and bugs. Sand also radiates
heat to prevent the vines from freezing in our cold New England winters.
While vines may freeze into the ice without harming ’em they
mustn’t be chilled by the cold wind, if you can figure that one out.
Mr. Atwood spreads nearly ten thousand yards of sand each year.
He’s got a lot of grit, wouldn’t you say?</p>

<p class='c001'>This big bog&#8212;that’s Fourteen Acre; a record breaker. Shells out
nearly eighty barrels to the acre!</p>

<p class='c001'>Where did that pile of sand come from? A mile up the line is his
sand-pit. A power shovel loads it onto flatcars and the train hauls it
to these different sand piles; there’s seven or eight thousand yards in
that pile there. When sanding time comes&#8212;but you aren’t interested
in all this; you want to see this pocket-edition railroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Look 'way across the big reservoir there: that’s the railroad coming
down the east side. Remember I showed you where it entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the yards just below the station? The smudge of smoke is a work
train. We’ll meet ’em either at the Ball Park or the sand pit.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Ball Park? Yes; or more correctly, the <i>Atwood Athletic Field</i>.
He built a baseball ground, picnic spot, and a few buildings there.
Plenty active all summer, too. We’ll be up there shortly now.</p>

<p class='c001'>Incidentally, it’s when we leave the Ball Park that the track swings
east and south again to go down the opposite side of this reservoir,
where the work train is now. It passes Sunset Vista, winds along the
lower end of the reservoir, and finally enters Edaville yard where I
pointed it out to you.</p>

<p class='c001'>I guess we’re off again. Can you make it?</p>

<p class='c001'>Isn’t Fourteen Acre a neat looking bog? Not all growers keep
their bogs as neat and trim as Mr. Atwood does. Sure, it costs.
There’s something satisfying in owning the finest cranberry plantation
in the world. When the railroad’s completed and there’s some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>time to spare he intends to erect signs around the bogs and at different
points of interest, explaining about cranberry culture, history,
production, and how bogs are built and cared for. Like a self-conducted
tour your ride’ll be then.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>We’re crossing a corner of undeveloped swamp now: just plain
mud and bushes. Potential bog land, though. Clear that jungle off,
dig out some of the mud and dump in clean sand, set out the cranberry
vines&#8212;as you’d plant strawberries or rosebushes&#8212;and presto!
A new bog.</p>

<p class='c001'>New bogs cost close to three thousand dollars an acre. You must
wait four years before the berries come, too. In the end, though, it
pays off: a well built, properly kept bog, like these around here,
should be good for pretty nearly five hundred dollars an acre every
year. Yes, there’s gold in them swamps, but you and me needn’t
conjure up dreams of owning any. It’s a complicated and expensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>proposition. Takes years to learn. More men have gone broke in
the swamps than ever got rich out of ’em.</p>

<p class='c001'>What do you say: want to walk up through the train and see who’s
riding?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, this parlor car sure is cute. Mr. Atwood’s pet, too. (Look
out! don’t fall over that woman’s feet; she’s spread out there like a
pumpkin-vine.) He had painters and repairmen working half the
winter restoring this car to her school girl complexion. Most of her’s
solid mahogany. She would cost a queen’s dowry to build now: all
those inlaid woods, the filigree designs on her ceiling, the brass
lamps, expensive upholstery, plate glass windows&#8212;the splendor of
the legendary Nineties. Can’t buy those things for a song now. Notice
how contagious it is&#8212;that traditional humor of those old days.
Seems to have infected our carload of passengers today&#8212;even the
old girl with her feet clear across the aisle!</p>

<p class='c001'>Careful now: watch your step when we cross from the <i>Rangeley</i>
over to this coach ahead, the <i>Pondicherry</i>. These little puppies can
nip off your leg as quickly as the wide gaugers can.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite a car, the <i>Pondicherry</i>, isn’t she? That was the name she
had when she was new in 1883, up on the Bridgton &#38; Saco River.
Pondicherry was the original name of the town up there; changed it
to Bridgton later. I don’t know what it means but somehow I seem
to think of it along with County Down, Galway, or Connemara. Could
be Swedish or an Indian name, though.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thirty people can sit in these little one-butt seats. Notice the
carved wood and old fashioned windows. Mr. Atwood’s renovating
job was about perfect, wasn’t it? She was some little hack in 1883;
still is, too. Look into that nut-shell toilet&#8212;that’s where you need
the shoe-horn!</p>

<p class='c001'>These cars don’t sway much, do they? Steady and serene as a
Shore Line job. Edaville track is just as good, too, comparatively
speaking. This big rail&#8212;mostly fifty-six pounds to the yard&#8212;is
heavier in proportion than the New Haven’s big hundred and thirty
pound steel.</p>

<p class='c001'>How fast are we going? Oh, about twenty-five, I guess. Sometimes
when he’s feeling extra kipper the engineer inches her out a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>bit and No. 7’s two-bit drivers will really roll. Mr. Atwood doesn’t
approve of that, with a train load of his guests aboard.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cute little rig, isn’t she? See the mail-racks; and the slots in the
doors where you could mail a letter once upon a time. Some of these
philatelist fellers think it would be a super idea for Mr. Atwood to
arrange with the Postal Department for a one-day Railway Post Office
on the Edaville; mail clerks cancelling letters <i>Edaville &#38; Cranberry
Bogs R.P.O.</i> or something like that. Gosh! We’d pay off the
national debt with stamps that day. You know how wild stamp collectors
get about such things?</p>

<p class='c001'>Up here from the head platform, or blind end, as it used to be
called, you can get a closeup of No. 7 batting off the rail-joints. See
how she&#8212;Oh! here we are at the sand pit. He’s stopping. Let’s
drop off and see where all that sand comes from.</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  Here’s how the flatcars were trucked down from Maine; loaded three-deep on a C. E. Hall &#38; Sons diesel trailer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Wonder why everyone else is jumping off? I see: that work train’s
got in; they’re loading sand to grade the Sunset Vista picnic ground,
a flag stop down the east side. Their engine, little No. 3, came from
another of those Maine roads, the Monson. They had two just alike,
No. 3 and No. 4. Mr. Atwood bought them from a concern in Rochester,
New York, where they’d been taken when the Monson road was
scrapped in 1945. Yes, she’s lots smaller than No. 7. Weighs only
eighteen tons. She has inside frames, like wide gauge engines do.
No. 7 and No. 8’s frames are <i>outside</i> the wheels, you know.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Monson engines were built by the Vulcan Iron Works down
in Wilkes Barre, one in 1912 and the other in 1918. Their cylinders
are much smaller, too; only ten by fourteen inches. Carry a
hundred and sixty pounds of steam. The inside frames, which make
a narrower support for their balance, makes ’em ride different from
the big engines. Slop around more. They’ll scare you, too, until
you get used to them. Actually these inside framers are as safe as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the others; it’s just that their equilibrium is kind of emotional.
Nearly all the early two-foot locomotives had inside frames and
they’re the ones that hung up most of the slim gauge speed records.</p>

<p class='c001'>See: the big Lorain shovel over there is loading sand onto the flatcars;
ten cubic yards to a car, about fifteen tons. There’s usually a
work train out, doing routine plantation work along with construction
and maintenance duties. That’s what she’s doing: building the station
grounds at Sunset Vista.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wish you could have seen those flatcars when they first landed
here. Ready to fall apart. Sills rotten, flooring gone, and not a
brake working. Mr. Atwood hired Roland Badger, a millwright up
to Walter Baker’s; Badger is quite a railroad fan himself, has built
lots of little scale models for 0-gauge outfits. He was planning on
buying a pasture somewhere and making himself some quarter-scale
iron colts to run in it. However, the Edaville fits into his dreams
pretty well. He’s repaired or rebuilt about every car here: new
sills and floors, and got the brakes to working.</p>

<p class='c001'>They’re going out ahead of us! See how easily little No. 3 snakes
her train out of the pit. That tricky little caboose they’re hauling
came from the Sandy River, like the parlor car. When the Maine
Central owned the Sandy River, thirty years ago, they built a number
of those cabooses in their Waterville shops. About as perfect a
molecular reproduction of a wide gauge buggy as anything could be,
eh? I like that cupola. It’s quite a treat to ride up there surveying
Mr. Atwood’s eighteen hundred acres from such a vantage point.
We’ll see the work train again at Sunset Vista. Let’s go on to the
Ball Park now.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are you especially interested in railroads? This may not mean
much to you, but if a standard gauge car was built to these same proportions
it would be nearly twenty feet wide and twenty-two feet high!
Actually they’re only ten feet wide and around twelve or thirteen feet
high. Shows you how large, in proportion, these two-footers are.
An overhang on either side that’s greater than the gauge of track!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Still, they don’t feel like you’re riding a tight rope, do they? Personally,
I think what this country needs is more two-foot gauges!</p>

now. Pretty well to the farther end of Mr. Atwood’s cranberry empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>They’re having a ball game up here today; South Carver Sunday
School playing the West Wareham Firemen&#8212;seems to be an appropriate
analogy there, don’t you think? Sunday Schools usually do
oppose people who’re heading for the Fire! Two hundred people
watching that game; came up on a special train right after dinner.
Those people 'way over at the edge of the woods, they’re Plymouth
Kiwanians having their annual clambake. They’re great for clam
bakes down here; say it makes ’em tough.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh: you wanted to see one of the motor cars. Here’re two of
them. This Model T touring car I like best; Sandy River built her
in their Phillips shop. Master Mechanic Lee Stinchfield designed
them all. He ought to be with Electro-Motive; he’d design diesel
locomotives better’n they have now! They’re the neatest little rail
cars I’ve ever seen. Mr. Atwood has two of these T Models; this
touring, and a canopy body truck. They have a wholly different
rear-end arrangement: kind of a “take-off” idea; put a little lever in
forward gear and they’ll scoot away in high. Put it in back position
and you fly backwards in high! This touring car was Superintendent
Vose’s private car; he thought nothing of dropping down
from Redington in twenty minutes; sixteen crooked, hilly miles. In
winter he’s often pushed snow ahead of her radiator. They saved
the Sandy River lots of money when otherwise a steam train would
have gone out with fire-fighters or a repair crew. They save Mr. Atwood
a lot. Quicker and cheaper than a pickup for cranberry men
to run around in.</p>

<p class='c001'>This other one here, the G4, is quite a wagon: something like the
big gas-electrics on wide gauge roads. She seats fifteen people and
used to haul a four-wheel trailer for mail and express. In summertime
the Sandy River ran two of these rail-buses in place of steam
passenger trains. Mr. Atwood occasionally uses this one to carry
some visitors over the road but it’s mostly a sort of de luxe work car
for his own crews.</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, there goes No. 7’s bell: must be we’re leaving again. Want
to ride the engine down to Sunset Vista? Mr. Atwood won’t like this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>if he sees us as it’s strictly against the rules; insurance company, or
something. All settled? Keep off that steam pipe or you’ll be settled

whole plantation’s in sight. There’s the big reservoir, Number Two,
three hundred acres. Holds millions of gallons. Water is all
pumped in from the river over back of the Ball Park. Fish come
in through the pump, too, believe it or not!</p>

<p class='c001'>These are new bogs he’s building; started ’em last year. Aren’t

<p class='c001'>Sunset Vista’s about a mile down here. They called it Ridge Hill
before the railroad came. Mr. and Mrs. Atwood used to come out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>here and sit in their Packard to watch the sunset. They enjoyed it.
Said it was so restful and quiet. Must have been kind of a sacrifice,
too, when they gave it up so others could enjoy it. Certainly is nothing
restful nor quiet around here now, since everyone and their inlaws
took it over for sunset picnics. Trains drop ’em off late in the
afternoon and pick them up again along in the evening. There’s even
talk of band concerts. It’s here that the Atwoods will probably have
their big Christmas pageant this year&#8212;but maybe I’m letting the
tabby out of the bag. Well, we’re almost there. He’ll stop, because
that work train is out ahead of us.</p>

may lay a connecting track across this dike. Only a stone’s throw.

Mr. Atwood bought her up to Quincy a year or so ago. Alec MacLellan,
a railroad fan, told him about her. You should have seen
her then: about the sorriest little mill you could imagine. No cab,
no bell, no nothing. Mr. Atwood’s crew took over and, patterning
their dream-engine after those big he-Plymouths, they built her into
this trim little cock-sparrow!</p>

<p class='c001'>For real economy she puffs black all over the ledger. Will haul
two or three cars like nobody’s business; will do shifting and light
work as well as a steam engine. One man can run her without continually
getting down to tend his fire. Has her limit, of course; but
she weighs only four tons.</p>

<p class='c001'>There: the work train’s going out; the passenger is hauling up to
the depot to swap passengers for her next trip; I think that No. 4 is
going out around the Edaville loop into the station that way. Why
don’t we ride in on her?</p>

ride? A little more jerky than No. 7 but still no worse than lots of
wide gauge pots I’ve been on. She’s got steam brakes. No. 7’s and
8’s are vacuum. Those two-footers used all kinds of things for
brakes, from modern air to such childish devices as brakemen dragging
their feet. They always managed to stop, though. And now
they’ve stopped for good&#8212;all excepting the Edaville.</p>

<p class='c001'>There’s the parlor car, for instance: got air and vacuum both on
her. She used to run over the Sandy River and the Phillips &#38; Rangeley,
so when they built her she had the kind of brakes used by each
road&#8212;vacuum and Westinghouse. No. 4 can pile you through the

<p class='c001'>Yes, these little pigs did a lot of work up there in northern Maine.
You should have seen them settle down to dragging a train of slate
up the hill. That Monson road always used link-and-pin couplers,
too; never changed over to automatic. I don’t know how they sidestepped
the Government laws, but they did. Common carrier, at that.
Link-and-pin couplers, stub switches, and hand brakes; just about as
modern as a ramrod rifle. Far as I know it was the last road left
that hadn’t turned the century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here’s that switch again: he’s throwing it for the loop. In a minute
we’ll be backing up through the woods and into the station. Two
tracks there; we’ll clear the passenger.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite a trip, wasn’t it? Have a good time? Everyone does; even
old timers who’ve railroaded for years. Mr. Atwood’s Edaville Railroad’s
got something they never saw before!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>We’re back. See the crowd on the platform! Soon’s the train is
unloaded there’s a fresh batch to take out. It’s like that all the time
now. Lots of folks keep getting back on again, riding all day. Mr.
Atwood doesn’t mind as long as there’s room for the new-comers.
Wouldn’t some big railroads enjoy a passenger trade like this? It
sure costs plenty for the Atwoods to give everyone these rides, but
they’re like that: never satisfied unless they’re doing things to make
other people happy&#8212;kind of sharing their good fortune with the
world at large, you might say. It’s not lost, though: all adds up to
good cranberry advertising, and cranberries is what makes Edaville
the top-pucker plantation in the world, and this manikin railroad a
lucky survivor of a less lucky kind of railroad design. Let’s go into
the station.</p>

<p class='c001'>There’s Mr. Atwood sitting up to the lunch counter with the boys,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>eating steamed clams. Wonder that man doesn’t turn into a steamed
clam. Personally, I’d just as soon have baked chicken. Here: we’ll
sit over by the fireplace with those yarnsters, until the clams are gone.
I’m tired, anyway. Notice those things more after forty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it supper time? In half an hour the <i>Sunset Special</i> will pull out
for her curfew run. That’s a pretty train. Sunset seems to show up
better out there where there’s plenty of room. We’ll stick right here
so’s not to miss it.</p>

<p class='c001'>See that headlight up on the wall? Big’s a boxcar. Came off one
of the old Bridgton engines when they changed to electric glims.
This one’s oil. Mr. Atwood has lots of relics in here. You’ve no idea
what a show he’s got! Only difference between he and Phin Barnum
is that Atwood isn’t trying to kid anybody. His is the real McCoy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes: ten little railroads all switched into one: the Edaville. Did
you ever stop to think why he named it that&#8212;<i>Edaville</i>? Can’t you
guess? Sure, that’s it: his own initials, E.D.A. Pretty cute, eh?</p>

<p class='c001'>Wait ’til I light my pipe ...</p>

<p class='c001'>Those old two-footers were some roads. Many of my happiest
recollections are of rides I had on the Wiscasset road and the Sandy
River. Never saw so much of the Bridgton line until the last year it
ran. The Kennebec Central checked out before I checked in, although
I used to see their tiny trains when I was a kid. I knew the
little Monson&#8212;<i>the Two by Six</i> they called it, two feet wide and six
miles long&#8212;but only after it got kind of dilapidated. I’ve seen ’em
all. And here’s the last one: using the very same engines and cars
that I used to ride on years ago. Seems funny, too: to come down
here and find ’em resurrected again. Those little pikes tried so hard
to climb up to the sun, and a bumping-post in the sunset was the best
they could do. The sunset of pint-size railroads.</p>

<p class='c001'>Funny: here’s this last one, here in eastern Massachusetts; and
seventy some years ago the <i>first</i> one got its christening within a few
miles of this very spot. Up in Billerica, where the B. &#38; M.’s big
shops are now. Someone must have swung the bottle too hard and
konked the little cuss on its pituitary gland. Anyway, besides being
a baptismal ceremony it was a death blow too.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>It was this way: a feller named George Mansfield from up Lowell
way had taken a trip over to Wales (coal-passing, most likely) and
was pretty well sold on the two-foot Festiniog Railway there. The
Festiniog was the very first of these flea gauges, and had been built
fifty years before George went back. He couldn’t see why they
wouldn’t be just as successful over here; kind of miscalculated on his
grand-children’s idiosyncrasies, though. George returned to the New
World as full of ideas as a New Dealer. You might say he’d got
narrow minded&#8212;two-feet wide. He bla-blaad to everyone who’d listen
and when they stopped listening he hired a hall and gave away
a new Ford on the lucky ticket. He talked two-feet gauge. He may
have even drawn chalk pictures. He built a sample railroad in his
back yard with two-by-four for rails. Named it the Sumner Heights
&#38; Somethingwood Valley. Luckily he didn’t have an eighteen hundred
acre lot or the Edaville would be just another backyard railroad
today.</p>

<p class='c001'>That was in 1877. They built the Billerica &#38; Bedford Railroad,
two feet wide and eight miles too long.</p>

<p class='c001'>Its vicissitudes don’t mean much now excepting because it was the
first of these bobtailed scooters to puff into our history, and because
that christening wallop was so robust the little pike turned up its
brogans the very next year. Therein it suffered the doubtful honor
of being not only the first fly-speck choo-choo in North America, but
also the first one to ask official permission to abandon its entire line!</p>

<p class='c001'>George, though, hadn’t been idle. Instead of staying home minding
his baby he’d been rusticating in the wilds of Maine talking convincingly
to the railroad minded folks up there. In fact, the spacious
old Jim Hill sold ’em not only the idea, but the moribund Billerica &#38;
Bedford Railroad as well!</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes: as a result of his glib missionary work the Sandy River Railroad
made a three point landing in Farmington, Maine, complete with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the B. &#38; B.’s two forney locomotives, and handful of cars, and eight
miles of rail. That was the real beginning of down to earth two-footing.
The bantam railroad clicked up there, and it made good,
too. Quicker than you can spit they’d laid eighteen miles of track up
through Strong to Phillips, a good part of it on the seventy-four
trestles that boosted it over gullies and ravines, and forthwith began
doing more business than a beer-joint in Plymouth.</p>

gross earnings. Darned few wide gauge roads ever did that! Today&#8212;well,
if a road breaks even everyone walks around the table shaking
hands and passing out seegars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh I could gab for hours about it: how those towns raised money
to build it on the express condition that trains be polluting the virgin
air of Phillips by November 20, 1879 or not one blankity-blanked
penny would they pay. And how, the night before, track still lacked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>half a mile of the town line&#8212;but maybe all this moldy lore of sixty-eight

track-layers look like sit-down strikers. More B. T. U.’s
sparked off that night than in the whole city of Boston. The little

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>As I was saying, almost before that first train got turned around
there was an avalanche of business. Exponents of the railroad were
slapping each other on the back and thumbing their beaks at the sour-puss
skeptics. A year or so later and all Franklin County was lathered
up: everyone wanted a railroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kingfield was first to get it. Somehow the Boston egg-men, A. &#38;
O. W. Mead, got snarled in it. They began their Franklin &#38; Megantic
Railroad, Strong to Kingfield, fourteen and a half miles, in 1884.
It was a pretty road. Full of curves as a chorus girl and lush with
wild, bucolic scenery. You could see Mount Abram looming up five
thousand feet, and Mount Bigelow was still higher. At Mount Abram
Junction you could almost spit on ’em, they were so close.</p>

<p class='c001'>This little pike didn’t swell with the financial pregnancy that busted
the more copious Sandy River shirt. The F. &#38; M. was always broke.
A cussed feeling, too; take it from me. Several reorganizations and
the final exodus of the Mead boys made no difference. While they
managed to relay the original twenty-five pound rail with bigger
thirty-five pound stuff they did little grade improving or curve relocation.
Track went up and around with the whims of Mother Nature,
and the old harridan whimmed plenty in that rugged country.</p>

<p class='c001'>The snow they had! You should see some of the old pictures of
snow-fighting (Maybe Mr. Atwood has some here); it was nothing to
see a man’s head sticking out, and then learn that he was standing on
top of a boxcar.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the early '90’s, under the paper name of Kingfield &#38; Dead
River, the F. &#38; M. built fifteen and a half miles of road from Kingfield
up through Carrabasset to Bigelow, a booming lumber town.
Today Bigelow <i>ain’t</i>. You just drive up through there and wonder
where the place was. This thirty mile line rivaled even the P. &#38; R.
in wild, rustic beauty. If only those wintry hills could have been
cranberry country!</p>

<p class='c001'>About this same time some other Massachusetts business men (See:
the Bay Staters were always the power behind these midget gauges!)
dumped their pennies into the twenty-nine mile Phillips &#38; Rangeley
Railroad, from Phillips up over Redington Mountain to Rangeley.
You should have seen it. What a railroad. One reverse curve after
another; three and four per cent grades with Sluice Hill and the
Devil’s Elbow going over five per cent. Grand country, too: wooded
hills spouting white-water streams&#8212;where trout frolic in the rapids
and thumb their little noses at you.</p>

pushed along the old grade you might find hidden ruins&#8212;a moss-covered
foundation or a scrap of rusty boiler plate. Not a building
left.</p>

<p class='c001'>Purposive branch lines wandered through the woods, like stray
cats. I don’t know who used all the lumber but quantities of it rolled
out over the narrow gauge during the next thirty years.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Once they had seventeen engines working, and few went out again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>at night. Thirty-three men labored at the Farmington transfer loading
freight from little cars into big ones. Two and sometimes three
baby cars made one wide gauge load.</p>

<p class='c001'>I suspect that the same money was pretty much behind all these
Franklin County roads. In 1908 the big Consolidation came off: the
F. &#38; M., P. &#38; R., the Madrid, and the old Sandy River merged into
the new Sandy River &#38; Rangeley Lakes. Three years later the Eustis
Railroad joined up too, giving the new S. R. &#38; R. L. a total of 120
miles of line&#8212;logging branches and all. Seventeen locomotives and
nearly four hundred cars, including Franklin County’s pride, the
<i>Rangeley</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1911 the Maine Central scratched its chin reflectively, and
bought the outfit, lock, stock, and ramrod.</p>

<p class='c001'>In some ways this was a good thing. The big road made some
money, and they did a lot of improving such as heavier rail, new engines
and cars, as well as kind of guiding the baby to complete maturity.
That caboose you just saw on the work train was one of the
cars they built.</p>

<p class='c001'>This parentage lasted eleven years. For some reason, in 1922,
the Maine Central sold the jack-rabbit to a pair of local tycoons.
These boys, a Kingfield lumber king and a Gardiner banker, owned it
right through to the end, in 1935&#8212;June 29, to be exact.</p>

<p class='c001'>Maybe I fumbled by telling you about the Sandy River first. She
was the grand climax to the others. A modern railroad, abbreviated
down to brownie size. Regular engines with eight-wheel tenders.
Parlor cars. Telegraph. Air brakes. And a super machine shop
where engines could be completely taken down. Most impressive
of all, perhaps, crews who talked railroad, lived railroad, and could
defy any others to out-railroad them!</p>

<p class='c001'>The other roads weren’t; not so much, anyway. They used vacuum
brakes or simply stuck a hickory in the brake-wheel and laid back on
it. Their operation was more short-line, jerkwaterish, and patchy.
The Bridgton &#38; Saco River (and if you don’t mind, that’s pronounced
SAW’ko) was nearest to the Sandy River in this kind of excellence.
Maybe due somewhat to Maine Central influence, too. While the
Wiscasset road was the only one to have a separate-tender engine like
the Sandy River’s it wasn’t nearly as up to date and spic and span as
the Bridgton line.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The B. &#38; S. R. was built in 1882. The first train into town was on
January 21 the following year, “packed with exultant citizens and
numerous representatives of the rising generation”, so writes William
McLin in his interesting history <i>The Twenty-four Inch Gauge Railroad
at Bridgton, Maine</i>. The Edaville gets demonstrations of that
“rising generation” idea, too!</p>

<p class='c001'>This sixteen mile line ran from the Maine Central at Hiram up
through some pretty wild country to Bridgton, and fifteen years later
another six miles to Harrison was added&#8212;along the shores of Long
Lake. They ran lots of trains, too. See that old time card over here
on the wall: looks like a lineup of Braintree Locals.</p>

<p class='c001'>They made money. Probably that’s why the Maine Central bought
it in 1912. Like the Sandy River’s case, they made lots of improvements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>although the little tike was in pretty good shape anyway. The
machine shop was in Bridgton but it wasn’t on a par with the Sandy
River’s Phillips shop; most of the heavy work went to Thompson’s
Point for the Maine Central to do. Mr. Atwood has that machine
shop here in Edaville now.</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, by this time people must have decided that George Mansfield
was a second Moses and that his slim gauge railways puffed
right into Heaven. Infection had spread like chicken-pox. The Monson
Railroad, 'way up Moosehead Lake way, had been built in 1883,
six miles long with a couple of miles in slate quarry spurs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Monson slate went all over the world. Still does. Bathtubs, shingles,
switchboards, and gravestones. Kind of a womb-to-tomb business,
you might say. Far as I know the Monson never aspired beyond
the horizon, whereas its contemporaries planned to go clear to hellangone,
although none of ’em ever got there.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In a way, though, I suppose they <i>all</i> got there. The bubble busted
twenty-five years ago and the Golden Age was on skids. Hard to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>whether competition, cussedness, or just plain luck was the reason.
Whatever it was, their teeth fell out, ribs showed through, joints
ached, and Dr. Quack shook his head hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Calamity number one came in 1929. The smallest of the lot&#8212;baby
of the family, so to speak&#8212;took the colic and pegged out. The
five mile Kennebec Central.</p>

<p class='c001'>The K. C., built in the early 90’s, was used chiefly to haul things
from Kennebec steamers at Gardiner to the Soldiers’ Home at Togus,
coal being the biggest item. A competing trolley line from Augusta
hadn’t helped their lucrative passenger business and when the benevolent
Government awarded the coal haul to some trucks it didn’t leave
the Kennebec Central much to live for. So, she went in her sleep.

<p class='c001'>While I think of it: someone was asking about the little engine over
to Putnam, Connecticut. William Monypeny up to Cambridge owns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>it; bought her from the W. W. &#38; F. which had recently got it from the
defunct Kennebec Central. His mile of twenty-five pound rail also
came up from the K. C. (No: you can’t buy it. He wants it as much
as you do!)</p>

<p class='c001'>Four years later&#8212;at 7:23 in the morning of June 15, to keep these
dates straight&#8212;the forty-four mile Wiscasset road bit the dust.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a way the Wiscasset, Waterville &#38; Farmington Railway was the
first two-footer. It was chartered 'way back in 1854. Actually,
though, the narrow width wasn’t decided upon until just before construction
began, in 1894.</p>

<p class='c001'>In general interest, if not in physical excellence, I think this road
rated next to the Sandy River. Maybe its long haul influenced that.
Started as the Wiscasset &#38; Quebec Railroad its history is a long
complaint of frustrations and tantrums. I won’t go into it because
the <i>Sunset Special</i> is nearly ready to go. You mustn’t miss it.
Anyway, the W. &#38; Q. was going to do big things: lay rails clear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Quebec Province, have de luxe trains with diners, sleepers, and parlor
cars to make the <i>Rangeley</i> look like a trapper’s camp. They were
going to swipe the million dollar grain haul away from the Grand
Trunk&#8212;just like that. Wiscasset has a fine harbor and is a little
nearer Liverpool than Portland, which was the basis for their stock-selling
argument.</p>

<p class='c001'>While crews were laying steel up the Sheepscot valley other men
were building some old-histing great wharves at Wiscasset for the
steamboat line to New York. They never splashed a paddle but to
hear stock salesmen gab you’d have thought another Fall River Line
was in the making.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Its first hop was to Burnham, fifty-five miles up. Old Frustration
set a derail here: the Maine Central were opposed to a crossing of
their Belfast branch; so submissively and sulkily the little pike backtracked
to Week’s Mills (twenty-eight miles above Wiscasset) and
began a line from there to Waterville and Farmington, hoping to
make the Quebec trip with the help of Sandy River rails to Rangeley.
However, the Maine Central again boxed the W. &#38; Q.’s flapping ears
by refusing to let ’em cross Maine Central tracks at Farmington to
connect with the Sandy River.</p>

<p class='c001'>By now the Wiscasset dwarf was a confirmed neurotic. It just
threw a fit, abandoned its grand ideas and miles of nearly completed
line, and testily began to operate over such track as it could be sure
of&#8212;Wiscasset to Waterville (actually to Winslow, on this side of the
river), and Week’s Mills to Albion. Shortly thereafter they discarded
even the Winslow line, and from then until 1933 the forty-four
miles from Albion down to Wiscasset was all that was left of
the grandiose W. &#38; Q. Even this imposing name faded out to the
jaw-breaking misnomer Wiscasset, Waterville &#38; Farmington which
folks sometimes called <i>Weak, Weary &#38; Feeble</i>; just as they dubbed
the B. &#38; S. R. <i>Busted &#38; Still Running</i>. Awful, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class='c001'>The W. W. &#38; F. was the only one of these little roads to keep the
Railway Post Office route. All the others&#8212;the Farmington &#38; Rangeley,
and the Bridgton’s mailcar&#8212;were taken away during the other
war. This one, though, stayed to the last run.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were&#8212;let’s see: one, two, three ... there were ten stations
on the line, some being rail points for stages from other post-offices,
too. Must have been twenty or more offices served by this R. P. O.</p>

<p class='c001'>Its worst mess of all came in 1931 when a mortgage-monger who
controlled some timberlands up in Palermo got hold of the road.
That’s a good story, too, but we’ll have to skip it now except to say
that the road didn’t improve any under his ownership, and track got
so rough there was no fun riding on it. Coming down that morning,
June 15, they’d just left Whitefield station when <i>Crash!</i>&#8212;a broken
rail. The tiny Portland engine switched ends and dove down the
bank toward the river. A flatcar tail-feathered up behind her. The
cream-car careened. The last Railway Post Office wobbled feebly,
jolted to its last stop, and settled into the ballast for a good, long rest.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>That was the Weak, Weary &#38; Feeble’s last trip. Wreck was never

<p class='c001'>In 1935 the Sandy River, with its excellent line, trim engines and
cars, and business possibilities dunked its fire and went home. That
left two: the Bridgton line and the little Monson.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wish I had time to tell you about the Bridgton’s last sickness.
What a time they had! The town owned it, you know. Most of the
folks wanted to junk it while a few enterprising souls hung on. In
cahoots with some railroad fans its president, Lester Ames, put up a
lively scrap to save the little line. Lasted a couple of years, that
wrangling. First, the railroad champions would be on top, and then
their dark-complexioned adversaries were eye-gouging or had a knee
in the railroad’s bowels. It looked bad. Hard telling how long it
might have lasted but the <i>coup de grace</i> came suddenly when someone
slipped through a deal with an uninnocent junkman. Spikes flew.
So did Mr. Atwood.</p>

A-carded up there, plum full of adrenaline, and managed to buy
quite a lot of equipment. No. 7 engine, some cars, and the turntable.
Paid through the nose for it, too. Worse still, after paying the money
and assuming ownership, this junk-expert would turn around and cut
it up for scrap, claiming he didn’t know that Mr. Atwood wanted it!
Biggest wonder in the world he didn’t put the torch to No. 7 engine.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was all in 1941. That fall the track was gone and the cars
stored at Bridgton Junction. The connoisseur who’d previously
bought the parlor car, Eric Sexton of Rockport, Maine, also bought
some of these B. &#38; S. R. cars for the same reason&#8212;to preserve ’em
for posterity. Another fan, Edgar Mead, bought two or three. John
Holt and Van Walsh, who’d fallen in love with No. 8 engine, bought
her. That greasy junkman sure cleaned up on those fellers. In the
end, however, Mr. Atwood owned it all and got a corner on two-foot
gauge railroads!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Year ago last fall he arranged with the Somerville movers, C. E.
Hall &#38; Sons, to bring the things down here. He’d talked with the
railroad people but there were car shortages then, and besides the
Maine Central had dismantled their siding there at the Junction. He’d
have had to done the loading, to I. C. C. specifications, whereas the
Hall crews did it if he shipped by truck. So, the last of the two-foot
gauges came home to Massachusetts&#8212;by truck!</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite a sight seeing a railroad whizzing down the Boston road.</p>

<p class='c001'>Newspapers and magazines played it up plenty. Still do, in fact.

right, let alone because it’s the last of the two-foot gauges. It isn’t
completed yet, either. Doubt if it ever will be: there’ll always be a
new spur to build or a bog-siding somewhere to install. Maybe some

always get emotional when someone says diesel. Want to see the
Edaville go in the red? This railroad (although you’d never guess
it) isn’t a plaything; it’s a plantation utility, designed to facilitate
Mr. Atwood’s cranberry business. The passenger train and the parlor
car, and Sunset Vista, are gestures he and Mrs. Atwood make
from their own pockets to give people some fun down here&#8212;and to
have a little themselves. But he can’t run his freight trains at a loss
just to see coal smoke smudging all over those nice red cranberries.
Red’s a pretty color, but not on the ledger!</p>

<p class='c001'>Probably if the other two-footers had bought some Plymouth diesels
they’d all be running today. Lots of difference between coal at
ten bucks a ton and oil at ten cents a gallon. Personally I’m for it&#8212;a

are any criteria. This is how it seems to stew out though, so it’s how
you’ll have to take it. Keep cool!</p>

<p class='c001'>Lots of you won’t be interested in this Appendix. It’s designed for
the fellers who’re more or less railroad minded and thirst for technical
details. It’s a brief critique about the gears and rods that made
the wheels go round, during those hectic, vortical years. A cursory
account of engines and cars and mileage that made up the Edaville’s
immediate predecessors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here again we’ll have to condense the facts in favor of space. To
include a really comprehensive <i>expose</i> of these historical lines&#8212;locomotive
rosters and dimensions, car measurements and classifications,
capitalizations, earnings and expenses, and blow-by-blow reports
of the septuagenary rise and fall, as well as scale-drawings for
model fans&#8212;would be a book in itself, and a family-Bible size at
that. No one but the most serious students of railroad lore would

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Edaville Railroad</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Just when the Edaville was conceived is a risky guess. Maybe in
1941 when the moribund B. &#38; S. R. prodded Mr. Atwood’s imagination.
Maybe forty years ago when, as a lanky young feller, he mused
on the pleasure of owning something better than rickety sections of
portable track and tiny one-yard dumpcars.</p>

<p class='c001'>He did something about it in 1941, anyway. They were busting up
the Bridgton road. He bought the biggest part of it. Wars came.
You couldn’t call your soul your own unless it was kept out of sight.
Without an AA-12-PDQ-RSVP-1/2 priority there was no such thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>as moving things by freight, and these coveted ratings weren’t being
handed out to move narrow gauge railroads from Maine to South
Carver. Unless they moved into the Community Scrap Drive, and
I never understood how this one escaped those zealous patriots.</p>

<div class='ic002'><p>  Important in pygmy power development were the little Moguls. The Sandy River had engines with separate tenders as well as those like Mr. Atwood’s&#8212;built all in one piece.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It did have a tight squeak. Mr. Atwood was notified that his railroad
equipment might be seized anytime for Government use and for
him to leave it strictly alone. Engines and cars needed for self-defense&#8212;don’t
touch!</p>

<p class='c001'>Funny how it came out: A few weeks later he was advised he might
protect his ownership by moving everything to Carver at once. Mr.
Atwood tartly replied that such extravagant use of transportation
facilities and scarce gasoline, when our country was fighting for its
life, wasn’t becoming a patriotic gentleman. Mightn’t he wait until
the wars were done? An answer sizzled back! Henceforth he might
not only do as he pleased, but the government had oodles of railroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>equipment they’d like <i>to sell him</i>, war or no war. Would he buy?</p>

<p class='c001'>He wouldn’t; then.</p>

<p class='c001'>The wars petered out. We were allowed to use the gasoline again.
Big trucks and little ones headed north in the fall of 1945, and
rumbled back with loads of little cars. The City of New Bedford
owned a private railroad that once hauled coal to their Water Works
pumping station, and they agreed to sell. Two and a half miles of
fifty-six pound steel. Three miles more came down from the mountain
grades of Parker-Young Company’s logging road in New Hampshire.
Ties from Maine and more from the New Haven. Crews assembled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some desultory track-laying began in 1946 but it wasn’t until late
that fall that a former New Haven track man lined up his gang, and
work began in earnest. In the car shops repairs were progressing,
for the day when trains would begin to run.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Atwood did the engineering. He scooches to a transit as easily
as Farmer Jones milks a cow. He personally supervised everything
else, too; nothing was too small to escape his attention, no detail too
mean for his august decision. Mostly his own crews did the work.
When cranberry work could spare them they turned-to and became
railroad men. Except for the track boss no former railroad men were
hired, although Badger might as well have been an ex-Master Car
Builder: he knew enough to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>The locomotive crews are Mr. Atwood’s own cranberry men, instructed
in their exotic duties and performing them with remarkable
efficiency.</p>

<p class='c001'>Friends, visitors, and well-wishers have joined in offering suggestions
and criticisms to help the enterprise along. Mostly, though, it’s
been a series of inspirations plus years of secret planning from Mr.
Atwood himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Today the physical properties of his railroad are:</p>

scantiest of facts: With the Consolidation this new company inherited
a galaxy of equipment; whether or not all these units were renumbered
into the new S. R. &#38; R. L. roster, or if some older ones were
scrapped, is (and ever will be, probably) a moot subject among railroad
fans. I’ve spent hours&#8212;yes, months, trying to track it down
and willingly admit that I’m bewildered and as uncertain as before.
I admit, too, for the benefit of serious fans who believe they’ve identified
these old engines and cars, that some logical and chronological
sequences look pretty convincing; and that’s all. There’s no proof,
no positive evidence. I’m not extending my neck. Here’s an all-time

<p class='c001'>Sandy River 1st 3 was an O-4-4T Porter, sold to the W. &#38; Q.
in 1894. No. 6 was sold to the Kennebec Central about
1922 as their No. 4, and was acquired by the W. W. &#38; F.
in 1933.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cars: Another blank wall. The company’s <i>schedule of property</i>,
typed in 1935 for prospective scrap buyers, says they had 73 boxcars,
58 flats, and 136 “other freight train cars”. My own observations
around there would place the number of boxcars at nearly twice 73.
Several official reports had given the total number of freight cars as
350 whereas this <i>schedule</i> amounts to only 267. Just another of
those vicissitudes the historian must bang his head against!</p>

<p class='c001'>As for those “other freight train cars” they were probably the
swarms of flats fitted with rack sides, for hauling pulpwood. Some
may have been the truant boxcars. Ho-hum.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for passenger cars, this august <i>schedule</i> says “12 coaches, 3
combination, and 2 baggage”. The 3 combinations and 2 baggage
comes out all right, but I’m nostalgicly moved to wonder where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>hid all those twelve coaches all the years I used to be over there. I
was familiar with five. To be sure, there were a couple of old,
abandoned coaches and one retired combination boarded up, and
used as camps. But still, no twelve.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <i>schedule</i> lists six cabooses and four gasoline railcars. I’ve
seen eight cabooses, and ridden in five railcars. There were five
snowplows in service, and seven flangers. There were big turntables
at Farmington, Strong, Phillips, Madrid Station, Rangeley, and
Kingfield. Three-stall wooden enginehouses at Rangeley and at
Kingfield, and another at Bigelow before that Carrabasset-Bigelow
section was abandoned about twenty years ago. The big ten-stall
brick house at Phillips is still there, used for a woodworking mill.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chartered 1889; built 1890. 5 miles. Had no physical connection
with any other railroad, as its western terminus, Randolph, is
separated from the Maine Central’s “Lower Road” at Gardiner by
the Kennebec River. Barges unloaded Togus coal at the railroad
coal docks, on the Randolph side. The K. C. was also unique in having
no ballast supply on their line. All gravel was carted in to them,
the same as coal would be.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, we’ll call this an introduction to a two-foot gauge history.
Maybe our more accomplished brethren will call it less complimentary
names. If the printer will correct the misspelled words, and I
have any luck at South Carver next week taking pictures, maybe
<i>Edaville Railroad</i> won’t be so bad, after all.</p>
